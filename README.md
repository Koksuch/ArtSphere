Link to the original repository: https://github.com/wjakub072/ArtSphere

The project was created in a team of 4 people in a team activity
The aim of the ArtSphere project is to create an art gallery platform,
which will enable artists to promote and sell their artworks.

Due to the illness of one team member with the end of Sprint II 
the project continued with a group of 3.

In the project, I was responsible for creating most of Frontend.

The repository also contains a file with [User documentation](https://github.com/Koksuch/ArtSphere/blob/master/User%20Documentation%20-%20ENG.pdf) prepared for the project.
User documentation includes the appearance and description of the application's functionality.
